OSPO++ is a global network and a community of collaborative open source program offices (OSPOs) focused on supporting the core mission objectives of universities, governments, and civic institutions. We come together to build OSPOs, foster impactful collaborations between OSPOs, and build the core collaboration infrastructure for todayâ€™s most pressing challenges.

OSPO++ began as a community facilitated by Moss Labs, a loose organization of open source enthusiasts headed by Jacob Green of Baltimore, MD. Over time, the team expanded to include [Sayeed Choudhury](https://members.educause.edu/sayeed-choudhury) of Johns Hopkins and Danese Cooper of InnerSource Commons as advisors, and Clare Dillon of InnerSourceCommons and Open Ireland Network and Richard Littauer from SustainOSS and Maintainer Mountaineer. Moss Labs is dedicated to fostering collaboration, and has helped OSPO++ grow beyond the initial members by holding biweekly meetings, talks at conferences, seminar series, and podcasts.
