A Pattern - That's what we call InnerSource best practices codified in a specific format to make it easy to understand, evaluate, and apply them in your context.

These patterns have been collected by the [InnerSource Commons](http://innersourcecommons.org) community over many years. The most mature patterns have been published in this book. Mature in this context means that each pattern has been reviewed by members of the community, and has at least one known instance where this pattern has been used.

If you are using InnerSource in your company already and want to contribute your experiences to this book we would love to [welcome your contributions](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/contribute)!
