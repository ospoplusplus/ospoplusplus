# Guide To Set Up University Open Source Programs Offices (OSPOs)

## About
This guide has been created by the OSPO++ Community and is licensed under CC-BY-SA.

## Introduction

This guide is intended for universities or academic institutions seeking to build and support open source capacity including the creation of an open 
source programs office (OSPO). For the purpose of this guide and its content, an OSPO is defined as an organizational construct that acts as a convener, 
community steward and center of competency for open source software. In the university context, OSPOs need to account for the specific mission and cultural 
context. The overarching goal of a university OSPO is to maximize the social and economic impact of open source software for research, education, translation 
(i.e., impact of research and education beyond the university) and community engagement. The OSPO++ community and network emphasize OSPO to OSPO 
partnerships as a means for achieving impact at scale, particularly as it relates to open source software as a key component of digital infrastructure.

The recommendations and resources in this guide are aimed at individuals who would be the “champion” for setting up an OSPO, perhaps as its eventual Director. 
The guide is organized broadly into four stages of engagement for individuals or institutions who are:

Newcomers – “Where to begin?” 
Ready to engage – “We are ready to engage with leadership or stakeholders”
Have a particular focus – “We have a specific interest or project in mind”
Seeking to build a comprehensive OSPO – “We want to launch a comprehensive OSPO”

These stages are not meant to be linear, sequential or hierarchical. Given the diversity of universities, it is reasonable to expect that different 
institutions will adopt different strategies or actions, particularly over time. Naturally, the level of open source related research, education, 
student engagement, and interest in translation or dissemination beyond the university will influence specific institutional strategy and tactics.

The guide begins with a brief description of background and context regarding guides for building OSPOs. Subsequent sections of guide focus on each 
of the aforementioned stages of engagement. Throughout the guide, there are links to additional resources such as case studies, webinars, etc. and 
modules to be developed that will explore more deeply into specific topics or themes (e.g., OSPO and Technology Transfer).

Most importantly, this guide is intended to be a community developed, living document with input from a range of stakeholders. While OSPO++ will steward 
the initial development, this document will hopefully inspire others to create and share their own resources and expertise.
